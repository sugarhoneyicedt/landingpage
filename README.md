# landingpage

This is my first practice landing page! I will be trying to replicate this here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png

This is just some blur afor myself reflection on the assignment ---- 
Starting point-view: I know the flexbox will be tough, it is hoently the first thing I feel struggled with (tat and then github lol). Right now, I am at around 3/5 with difficulty. Looking forward to where I am mid point.
